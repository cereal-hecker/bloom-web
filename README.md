BLOOM

##

There are ample seminars and webinars happening in and around my college. And I learn so much from it. But how do I prove that I actually did? How do I prove that I am better than any other attendee who was distracted throughout the session?

This app works on the standardization of certifications given out to the students and attendees. The added USP is that we provide a platform to book the event/workshop/ talk/seminar/webinar completely if the user wants to do so.
By this, I am also able to provide satisfaction to the host that their efforts have not gone waste.

## Problem Statement

There is no standard system of grading for the attendees of webinars to judge the usefulness of the conducted webinar. People are still getting the certificate of participation that actually has no use.

## How do we solve it?

To work towards standardization of the grading system for the technical webinar/ seminar/talks or hands-on sessions, we can generate certificates in association with the hosting organization and grant certificates based on an assessment after the event ends. Thus, we give them a certificate of excellence. Bloom is not limited to just providing a way to impart knowledge and a way for people to manage events, it also aims on being a leading events companion, a companion credible enough for both the parties, event organizers as well as participants. Bloom will provide each organizer, no matter how small, a way to promote their event at a minimal fee and bring them event enthusiasts. Bloom has abundant potential to expand in future, as a business model, the opportunities have no limit.

## A Blooming Business

Our app Bloom can be a business if it is developed with the intention of generating revenue. Bloom works both on B2B
and B2C categories. We can charge fees from organizers for managing their event's promotion by offering in-app advertisements and priority listing in ads, certificate generation and distribution on the basis of their scores in the assessment, and attendee reviews. On the other hand, for customers, this can be done through a variety of methods such as charging fees for event ticket sales or offering premium features like event certificate generation and usage for a fee.
